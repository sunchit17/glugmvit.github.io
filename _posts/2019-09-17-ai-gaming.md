On Saturday, 5th October 2019, we hosted **Microsoft Minihack: AI Gaming**, powered by [Microsoft](https://www.microsoft.com/en-in) and [Subway](https://www.subway.com/en-US). Microsoft events are free, out-of-the-box workshops covering today's most relevant technology so you can share knowledge with your community, spend less time on content, and learn as you go.

There was a workshop followed by a mini-hackathon on the concepts covered in the workshop. The event was suitable for both beginners as well as experienced programmers.

This 10 minute video from SciShow will bring you right up to date on how an AI can play a game:
