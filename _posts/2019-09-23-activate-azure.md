 As a student, you can apply for the GitHub Student Developer Pack, which includes offers and benefits from GitHub partners.

 You can use the Github student developer pack to activate your Microsoft Azure account so that you can access the benefits.

 Below are the steps to be followed to get the student pack:

 1. Go to [Github Education](https://education.github.com "Github Education") and, in the top right, click on "Get benefits".
 Select the benefits for students.
 2. Under "Which best describes your academic status", you need to select 'Student'.
