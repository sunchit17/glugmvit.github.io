Learning HTML and CSS is hard, but it doesn’t have to be. This 14-chapter tutorial is one of the friendliest HTML and CSS guides on the Internet. Progate will walk you through everything from selecting a good text editor (which is surprisingly important) to building full-fledged, professional-quality web pages from scratch.

The goal is to make it as easy as possible for complete beginners to become professional web developers, so if you’ve never written a line of HTML or CSS, but you’re contemplating a career shift, grab a cup of coffee, take a seat, and let’s get to work!

It is a web service where you can learn to program online. From intuitive slides to many practice tests, you can learn what you want at your own pace.

Participants will learn the fundamentals of H​TML, CSS​ and ​JavaScript​ to take the first steps towards web development. They will learn some advanced topics and try their hands on web development during the Day 8 offline meetup. Finally, they will have an opportunity to showcase their skills and build their own project in the Webathon.

There will be a brief introduction on 22nd of February (Day 0) in room 104 NB for further clarification.
