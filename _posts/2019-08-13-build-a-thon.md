## About

Put your **talent**, **passion**, and **determination** to the test at a high-tech event that will feature all of the latest trends and technologies.

The goal of this **Build-a-thon** is to **prototype ideas**, **products** and **services** that are able to create **social** and **economic value** for the community by hacking everyday objects and using **open data**, **open-source libraries**, **public APIs**, **frameworks** for **fast prototyping** and **software development**, **microcontrollers**, **sensors**, and other **hardware** (e.g. **3D printers**, **beacons**, **wearables**, etc.).

This **Build-a-thon** will provide an opportunity for **brilliant young talents** to create their works with the help of **mentors** and **experts**, who—together with the panel of judges (see below)—will be on hand throughout their project, while also experiencing the unforgettable thrill of coming together with peers who share the same passion for technology and innovation.
