excerpt: List of all Bug Bounty programs and recommendations.
---
Before we explore the opportunity vectors, we need to understand the need and the depth of the given responsibility, 
Many companies build a safe interface and then challenge hackers/Pentesters to find vulnerabilities and break into the setup. Of course this happens in an ethical environment, as the said attack happens within a specified scope and under information to legal owners of the web app. The entire process, which can get rewarded the penetration testers with significant bounty on finding a valid security vulnerability is called as bug bounty.

### How Organizations Benefit from Bug Bounty Programs 
1. With bug bounty programs, organizations get clear picture of their system, increasing the 
likelihood that major vulnerabilities won’t be overlooked Or cause any potential damage. 
2. There is no such thing as a perfect system. No matter how much you test your software, it’s going to have some bugs. It’s best to get that bug detected and fixed so it doesn’t lead to any major loss, unlike data leaks, we read everyday. 
3. Importantly Bug bounty programs actually save money. A data breach can lead to millions of dollars’ worth of damages, not to mention the damage to the company’s reputation. Paying a few thousand dollars through a bounty program is much cheaper than losing valuable data. 

### How Hackers Gain from Bug Bounties 
- Bug bounty programs give them a great opportunity to test and hone their skills. 
- The challenge adds to the fun of hacking. Also, it is white-hat hacking, which means it’s ethical and completely legal, which is a great sustainable way. 
- They get cash rewards that can be quite substantial, ranging from 200$ to 50,000$+ 
- When they win a bounty, they gain recognition among their peers, and a good will is established as they are honored with mention in companies Hall of fame. 

### How worthful is it to try? 
Once you get with the flow of finding OWASP top 10 bugs, you start encashing your skills continuously for bounty. Which might be from 1,000$ to 10,000$+ for RCE, and 500$-8000$+ for SQL injection in an average program. In 2016, Apple announced they would offer a bounty of up to $200,000 to hackers who found vulnerabilities in their products – and they are not alone. Facebook, The Pentagon, Tesla, Google, and Microsoft all run similar programs, offering big bucks for big bugs. Facebook has actually paid people over $4.3 million since launching their bounty 
program in 2011. Telegram offers millions if you break their encryption. There is a huge underlying opportunity in front of us, needs to be capitalized
